Development notes
-----------------
- This repo hosts a lightweight browser game called **Frontier Odds**.
- No build step is required; open `index.html` in a modern browser to play.
- Keep styling in `styles.css` and logic in `script.js` for clarity.
- Prefer readable variable names and concise, explanatory UI copy in the HTML.

PR / commit notes
-----------------
- Summaries should mention gameplay or UX changes in plain language.
- No additional formatting requirements beyond the global instructions.
