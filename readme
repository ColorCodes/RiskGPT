Hello world!
Can you write me an HTML game I can play from my browser? It would be a game like RISK, where you move in a tile and roll a dice to take over the tile. It could take place on an earth like board. However, id like to add rogue-like elements. Like using money to buy artifacts that grant bonuses, or bonuses or nerfs when taking a tile or losing a tile. Have it so that i can play against a simple AI, against 3 other players. You have free creative control over the rogue-like elements.
There is nothing else in this project so far. Once you have made changes, you can rewrite this file.
